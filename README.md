# HackerRank-Problems
## Iâ€™m a strong believer that you practice like you play, little things make big things happen.
I get involved with problem solving by creating solutions to community problems. 
I learn about and practice problem decomposition, i.e. breaking down a big, complex problem into a series of small, achievable steps.
